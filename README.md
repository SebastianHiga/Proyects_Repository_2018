This repository is for academic usage. It been set only to have order in a College proyect. 
So for now it's closed to outsiders contribution (Sorry :'( )
Once the proyect finished the commits and request are going to be open for everybody, and a larger explanation about the proyect and their goals will be featured in this README file 

(For now it's kind of private, so if you have found this randomly, just ignore it until april 2019) 

All the commentaries are intended to be in English, but some are in Spanish. That's  because English is not the main language of any of the contributors. (Sorry for that too).

Happy Programming :D
